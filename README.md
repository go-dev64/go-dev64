### 👋 Hi there, nice to meet you ! 👋

I'm Guillaume, a passionate Python and Django developer based in Anglet, France. Currently freelancing, I am constantly on the lookout for new challenges and opportunities to refine my development skills.

💻 Technically speaking, I specialize in web development with Django, always keeping up with the latest trends and best practices in Python. I work on a variety of projects, from dynamic web applications to customized solutions for my clients.

🛠️ I began my career as a CNC Programmer and Technical Engineer in the aerospace industry, where I developed a strong foundation in precision engineering and technical problem-solving.

💼 Now, as a software and web developer, I work on projects across various sectors, including industry and aerospace. This allows me to bring a unique perspective to my work, blending my technical background with innovative software solutions.

🌟 My transition from aerospace engineering to software development showcases my adaptability and continuous pursuit of growth. I'm particularly interested in leveraging my diverse experience to work on web and software projects that intersect with the industrial and aerospace sectors.

🚀 I'm always open to collaborating on exciting projects or connecting with other developers. Feel free to get in touch!
